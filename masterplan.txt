STORY
	You are a tree spirit that comes out of a plant and your task is to bring back magic to the forest and make it flourish again?


TODO
	Main
		Currency: gold, seeds >> Search can either find gold, seeds or rare seeds?
			consolidate seedCollect, goldCollect, etc. into currencyCollect(currency, num)

		Animals:
			1. birds		5 seeds 			1 seed/s
			2. magpies		100? seeds			10? seed/s + gold???
			3. squrrels		10000 seeds			1000 seeds/s + acorns
			4. rabbits
			?. raccoons		acorns
			?. foxes
			?. deer
			?. wolves		?????? R WE GONNA SACRIFICE FRIENDS????

			birds (recruit with seeds)
			      -magpies randomly find jewels? <--use bottom left scrollable panel for "random events" log?
			      -different birds= different gems?     

		Revealing system: 
			Animals to recruit (buttons) are all silhouette with question marks until previous animal is recruited
				update image to real image when "unlocked"
			Animal/currency number and rate not added to inventory until unlocked

	Exploration/search?????
		every hour?? you can go on a "expedition"????
		brings back gold and other items
			some exploration only items tat are needed for the garden/alchemy lab????
			brings back collectables/artifacts????

	Nursery
		build nests to have + sparrows per second etc.

	Garden
		Search can randomly get _____ special seeds, and you can plant it in your garden.
		     -certain animals get special seeds too?
		Buy/clear plots of land--> gold to increase by sq.ft, each level = higher plant capacity 
		Harvest after a specific amount of time--->Do we need to have a list/array for this??
			-plants used as ingredients for potions (must have garden to unlock alchemy lab)
            -need certain plants to recruit certain animals? 
             
	Treasure Chest
		Collectables/artifacts
			comes in sets?
			ex.:	animal totem set - boosts productivity of specific animal
					gemstone set - ??? 

	Alchemy Lab
		Make potions from supplies
		Potions give a boost for a specific amount of time: increased gold rate, luck boost for treasure?

	Creature Log
		draw individual pictures and have descriptions (in addition to the middle panel updating like the shark game)

WIP
	ADD SAVE SYSTEM !!!
		Cookies or encrypted sequence???? both?????
		need to add a savefile parser that can make sure that the objects in savefiles have the correct attributes
			> don't load a object directly, parse it in

DONE
	implement changing middle panel with bottom nav buttons

















		Found this on stackoverflow for weighted randomizations, but you probably have a better way to do it:

		function randomWithProbability() {
 	   	 var notRandomNumbers = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];
  			var idx = Math.floor(Math.random() * notRandomNumbers.length);
  			return notRandomNumbers[idx];
				}
                      // if 1, add seed, if 2, add gold, etc?

		so we can have functions add/take away from the array to change probabilities/add new chance items when searching?
