TODO

    WIP:
	** implement changing middle panel with bottom nav buttons

	Main
		Currency: gold, seeds >> Search can either find gold, seeds or rare seeds?
		Found this on stackoverflow for weighted randomizations, but you probably have a better way to do it:

		function randomWithProbability() {
 	   	 var notRandomNumbers = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];
  			var idx = Math.floor(Math.random() * notRandomNumbers.length);
  			return notRandomNumbers[idx];
				}
                      // if 1, add seed, if 2, add gold, etc?

		so we can have functions add/take away from the array to change probabilities/add new chance items when searching?		
 			

		Animals:
			birds (recruit with seeds)
			      -magpies randomly find jewels? <--use bottom left scrollable panel for "random events" log?
			      -different birds= different gems?
			other animals increase gold/seed rates?     


	Garden
		Search can randomly get _____ special seeds, and you can plant it in your garden.
		     -certain animals get special seeds too?
		Buy/clear plots of land--> gold to increase by sq.ft, each level = higher plant capacity 
		Harvest after a specific amount of time--->Do we need to have a list/array for this??
			-plants used as ingredients for potions (must have garden to unlock alchemy lab)
            -need certain plants to recruit certain animals? 
             
	Treasure Chest
		Collectables/artifacts
			comes in sets?
			ex.:	animal totem set - boosts productivity of specific animal
					gemstone set - ??? 

	Alchemy Lab
		Make potions from supplies
		Potions give a boost for a specific amount of time: increased gold rate, luck boost for treasure?


STORY IDEA
	You are a tree spirit that comes out of a plant and your task is to bring back magic to the forest and make it flourish again?


IDEAS:
	creature log? so we can draw individual pictures and have descriptions (in addition to the middle panel updating like the shark game)
